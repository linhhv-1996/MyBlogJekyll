<h5>Hi, ðŸ‘‹ </h5>

<p>I always ask myself: <i>How can each of us develop our full potential?</i></p>

<p>Over the past ten years, I have answered this question by researching, teaching, practicing, and training on the knowledge and skills necessary to develop yourself and live a life of continuous creativity.</p>

<h5>You are more creative than you think!</h5>

<p>In todayâ€™s knowledge economy, we face constant change. Work changes. Relationships change. Work projects require complex skills and knowledge. Faced with that context, specialization is an advantage but also a disadvantage. To gain an added advantage in a constantly changing market, you need the skills to self-manage the ideas and knowledge you have accumulated. Those skills include:</p>

<p>1. Design a personal knowledge management system</p>

<p>2. Applying technology in self-management</p>
<p>3. Design core habits based on behavioral and brain science</p>
<p>4. Design a life worth living based on your values, vision, and goals</p>

<p>If you think youâ€™re not creative enough to turn your ideas into reality, youâ€™re not alone. I used to be like that too. And now, Iâ€™m here to share with you everything Iâ€™ve learned.</p>

<h5>Goodbye and see you soon!</h5>
<p>Thank you for visiting home.</p>

<p>I feel honored to be a part of your learning and growth journey. Your time and mental resources are extremely valuable, so I will do my best to make every moment you are here worth.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that you will have enjoyable moments reading my articles. If you find something useful for you then Iâ€™m happy.</p>
